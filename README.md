# Third Project at GeeksHubs Bootcamp

# VideoGame

This VideoGame consists of a fighting mechanism where we reproduce a 1vs1 battle in a team of 4. Each time a character is defeated, the next character inline will be spawn to fight and succesively.

The game itself is inspired by the theme of Wrestling. In my childhood I used to watch a show called WWE. This show was broadcasted on the spanish TV then, and many of us were used to watch it just because it was funny and entertaining.

That is why I tried to recreate the same atmosphere into this game, so you can also enjoy the same and maybe, maybeeee, shead a tear for the nostalgia.

## Fight Game.
